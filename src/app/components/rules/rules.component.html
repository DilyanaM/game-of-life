    The universe of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" target="_blank">Game of Life</a> is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square <i><b>cells</b></i>, each of which is in one of two possible states, <i><b>alive</b></i> or <i><b>dead</b></i>, (or <i><b>populated</b></i> and <i><b>unpopulated</b></i>, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li *ngFor="let rule of rules">
      <p class="rule-text">{{ rule }}</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>The initial pattern constitutes the <i><b>seed</b></i> of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a <i><b>tick</b></i>. Each generation is a pure function of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.</p>
